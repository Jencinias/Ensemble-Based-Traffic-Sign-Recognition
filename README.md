# Ensemble-Based Traffic Sign Recognition

## Goals and Objectives

The project aims to develop a robust traffic sign recognition system using ensemble methods with traditional machine learning algorithms, excluding deep learning models. The primary objectives include training and evaluating multiple base models, creating an effective ensemble, and assessing the ensemble's impact on the accuracy and generalization of the recognition system. The project strives to enhance the understanding of how ensemble methods can improve the performance of traditional machine learning models in real-world scenarios. 

## Review of Methods

The research will employ traditional machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, as base models for the ensemble. Individual models will be trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset, incorporating techniques such as feature extraction and hyperparameter tuning. Ensemble creation will involve implementing a majority voting system to combine predictions. Visualization techniques will be employed to analyze decision boundaries and understand the synergies between individual models in the ensemble. 

## Benefits Expected to Be Gained

The project anticipates improved accuracy and robustness in traffic sign recognition through the application of ensemble methods with traditional machine learning algorithms. Benefits include enhanced safety in autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assistance systems, as well as insights into the efficacy of ensemble techniques in image classification tasks. The research outcomes will contribute valuable insights to the field of automotive machine learning, fostering advancements in intelligent transportation systems without relying on deep learning algorithms.
